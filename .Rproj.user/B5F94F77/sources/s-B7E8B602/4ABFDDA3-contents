# Functions

- **`pd()`**: Compute the Probability of Direction (pd, also known as the Maximum Probability of Effect - MPE). It varies between 50\% and 100\% and can be interpreted as the probability that a parameter (described by its posterior distribution) is positive or negative (following  the medianâ€™s sign). It is defined as the proportion of the posterior distribution of the median's sign.

```R
# Compute the pdSimulate a posterior distribution of mean 1 and SD 1
pd(rnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = 1))
```


- **`rnorm_perfect()`**: Generate a sample of size n with a near-perfect normal distribution.

```R
x <- rnorm_perfect(n = 10)
plot(density(x))
```
