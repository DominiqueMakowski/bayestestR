These guidelines can be referred to by citing the package:

# Reporting Guidelines

Based on the previous [**comparison of point-estimates**](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/articles/2_IndicesEstimationComparison.html) and [**indices of effect existence**](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/articles/3_IndicesExistenceComparison.html), we can conclude that:

- For simple models and normally distributed posteriors, the **MAP estimate** seems to be more biased than the mean and the median of the posterior distribution.
- Aside from being more robust, the **median** makes more sense than the **mean** in a probabilistic framework (*e.g.*, there is 50\% chance that the true effect is either higher or lower than the median).
- The **traditional ROPE** (using a 90\% HDI) is not sensitive to delineate highly "significant" effects. The full ROPE (100\% HDI) does not present the same flaw.
- The **Probability of Direction (*p*d)** is the closest index to the frequentist *p* value.

**Thus, to minimally describe the posterior distribution of a parameter, we suggest reporting the *median* and the *90\% CI* for parameter characterisation and, in the context of null-hypothesis testing, the Probability of Direction (*p*d) for effect existence and, especially in the context of confirmatory analyses, the ROPE (full) with an explicitly specified range for effect significance.**

## Interpretation Rules of Thumb

**The following thresholds are presented as landmarks only, for comparison with the frequentist framework. Please consider with caution.**

- **Probability of Direction (*p*d)**

    - *p*d \< 95% ~ *p* \> .1: uncertain
    - *p*d \> 95% ~ *p* \< .1: possibly existing
    - *p*d \> 97.5% ~ *p* \< .05: likely existing
    - *p*d \> 99% ~ *p* \< .01: probably existing
    - *p*d \> 99.9% ~ *p* \< .001: certainly existing
    - *p*d = 100%: definitely existing

- **ROPE (full)**: Extra caution is required as tts interpretation highly depends on other parameters such as sample size and ROPE bounds.

    - *ROPE* \< 5%: possibly significant
    - *ROPE* \< 1%: likely significant
    - *ROPE* = 0%: definitely significant
