\title{Probability of Direction (pd)}
\usage{
pd(posterior)
}
\arguments{
\item{posterior}{vector representing a posterior distribution.}
}
\description{
Compute the Probability of Direction (pd, also known as the Maximum Probability of Effect - MPE). It varies between 50\% and 100\% and can be interpreted as the probability that a parameter (described by its posterior distribution) is positive or negative (following  the medianâ€™s sign). It is defined as the proportion of the posterior distribution of the median's sign.

\examples{
library(bayestestR)

# Simulate a posterior distribution of mean 1 and SD 1
posterior <- rnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = 1)
# Compute the pd
pd(posterior)
