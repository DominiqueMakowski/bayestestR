\usage{
bayesfactor_savagedickey(posterior, prior = NULL,
  direction = "two-sided", hypothesis = 0, ...)

\method{bayesfactor_savagedickey}{numeric}(posterior, prior = NULL,
  direction = "two-sided", hypothesis = 0, ...)

\method{bayesfactor_savagedickey}{stanreg}(posterior, prior = NULL,
  direction = "two-sided", hypothesis = 0, effects = c("fixed",
  "random", "all"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{posterior}{Vector representing a posterior distribution, or a \code{stanreg} object.}

\item{prior}{Vector representing a prior distribution (If \code{posterior} is a vector, otherwise ignored). If a prior is not provided, will sample from \code{~Cauchy(location = hypothesis, scale = sd(posterior))} (but this should be avoided).}

\item{direction}{Test type. One of \code{0}, \code{"two-sided"} (defult; two tailed),
\code{-1}, \code{"left"} (left tailed), \code{1}, \code{"right"} (right tailed).}

\item{hypothesis}{Value to be tested against (usually \code{0} in the context of null hypothesis testing).}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}

\item{effects}{Should results for fixed effects, random effects or both be returned? Only applies to mixed models. May be abbreviated.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the Bayes factor representing by how
much \emph{less} the null is likely under the posterior compared to the prior.
}
\description{
This method computes the ratio between the density of a single value (typically the null)
in two distributions, typically the posterior vs. the prior distributions.
}
\details{
This method is used to examine if the hypothesis value is less or more
likely given the observed data. For \code{stanreg} objects, if \code{prior = NULL},
the model is updated to incliude prior-information and then for each model
parameter the prior is compared to the posterior distributon.
\cr \cr
A Bayes factor greater than 1 can be interpereted as evidence against the null,
at which one convention is that a Bayes factor greater than 3 can be considered
as "substantial" evidence against the null (and vice versa, a Bayes factor
smaller than 1/3 indicates substantial evidence in favor of the null-hypothesis)
(\cite{Wetzels et al. 2011}).
